### âœ… **Project Summary:**

This is a **React-based frontend application** for a *Defect Tracker* system, which:

* **Authenticates users**
* Lets them **add defects** (like bugs or issues)
* Allows viewing/filtering of existing defects

Right now, it has:

* **Hardcoded login** (`admin` / `12345`)
* **Basic role-specific UI logic** (though not fully implemented â€” both tester/developer views are visible to any logged-in user)
* **In-memory storage only** (no backend/API connected)

---

## ðŸ§­ App Flow Overview:

### 1. **Login Page**

* Shown **by default** when the app loads.
* Accepts a hardcoded login:

  * **Username:** `admin`
  * **Password:** `12345`
* On success: sets `loggedIn = true` and shows the main app UI
* On failure: shows error message for 3 seconds

---

### 2. **Navbar (after login)**

* Contains three main buttons:

  * `Logout` â€“ logs the user out
  * `Add Defect` â€“ shows form to add a defect (via `AddDefect` component)
  * `View Defect` â€“ shows defect list + filters (via `ViewDefect` component)

---

### 3. **Add Defect Page (`AddDefect.jsx`)**

* Allows user to:

  * Select a **category** (UI, Functional, Change Request)
  * Add a **description**
  * Set **priority** (optional; defaults to 100)
* On submit: logs data to the console & shows alert
* Note: The data isn't saved anywhere permanent (no backend or localStorage yet)

---

### 4. **View Defect Page (`ViewDefect.jsx`)**

* Displays a **hardcoded list** of defects
* Includes basic **filter dropdowns** (category & priority)

  * These dropdowns **change state**, but do **not yet filter the defects**
* Each defect row shows:

  * Category, Description, Priority, Status (open/closed), and Action

---

### 5. **Styling**

* Styling is split between:

  * `App.css` for general layout & login styles
  * `Style.css` for defect-related UI
  * `index.css` for page alignment & containers

## ðŸ§© Component Structure:

| Component        | Purpose                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `App.jsx`        | Root component; handles login state       |
| `LoginPage.jsx`  | Login form UI & logic                     |
| `Navbar.jsx`     | Navigation bar + routing between views    |
| `AddDefect.jsx`  | Form to submit a new defect               |
| `ViewDefect.jsx` | Table view of defects with filter options |

---

## ðŸ§  Current Limitations:

1. **No persistent storage** â€“ Data is not saved anywhere (just console logged)
2. **Role-based access** is mentioned but not implemented (e.g. Tester vs Developer)
3. **Filtering in `ViewDefect`** doesnâ€™t actually filter the defects yet
4. **No backend/API integration**
5. **No validation/feedback after adding defect (besides alert)**

---

## âœ… Overall, I've Built:

* A working **login-gated frontend UI**
* Functional **form handling** and **conditional rendering**
* Reusable components with clean separation
* A solid **base to build on further** (e.g., with role support or backend)
